Purpose:
	Provide a web service to respond with information
	regarding certain known aspects
	of the connected client.

Project parameters:
	Utilize the golang programming language.

Result:
	A hosted language named IPGO,
	utilizing the HTML and CSS languages,
	was created.

	IPGO is used to run external programs
	to obtain relevant information
	and to create web pages.

Instructions:
	Create your website directory structure
	where your apache2 or nginx or whatever
	can find it.
	
	your_website
		    |
	    	    bin
	    	    |
	    	    html
	    	    |
	    	    css
                    |
		    images
		    
	Set the __your_website__ variable
	in install-ip, to your website directory.
	Execute ./install-ip.

To examine the target platform code that is generated by IPGO:
   Provided services are:
   	    your_website/bin/ip.cgi
	    your_website/bin/ip.cgi?help
	    your_website/bin/ip.cgi?version
	    your_website/bin/ip.cgi?host
	    your_website/bin/ip.cgi?whois

	    Load the page in a browser
	    and use the browsers' view source capability
	    i.e. CTRL-u

	    or

	    with the bash shell:
	    	 export QUERY_STRING=whois
	    	 export REMOTE_ADDR=8.8.8.8

	    then execute the commands:
	   	 ./ip.cgi?whois > tmp.html
		 emacs tmp.html
